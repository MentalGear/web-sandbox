- prefer guard clauses instead of nested ifs
- keep original comments
- use modern ESNEXT
- write highly readable and elegant code
- prefer for loops over  higher-order array methods (.maps, .filter, ...) if they are less readable but otherwise have the same functionality and performance
- do not chain higher-order array methods directly, but always use temp vars in-between to maintain clear readability
- always sanitize (function) inputs before applying them. If you apply first and then sanitize/check, an error in the sanitization could keep unwanted input stored as valid.
- use smaller functions: apply the unix-principle of doing "one thing"
